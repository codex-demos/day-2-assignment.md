# Week 2: Day 2 Assignment - Building an Accessible Web Page with ARIA

## Objective

Create an HTML web page that effectively utilizes ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) tags to enhance accessibility. This exercise aims to solidify your understanding of web accessibility principles and the practical application of ARIA tags.

## Instructions

This assignment involves developing an HTML-only webpage that demonstrates the use of ARIA tags to improve web accessibility. The webpage should be structured and deployed using GitHub Pages.

### Part 1: Creating the Webpage

- **Create a New Repository**:

  - On GitHub, create a new repository named `ARIA-Accessibility`.
  - Initialize this repository with a `README.md` file.
  - Clone your new repository to your local machine.

- **Develop the Webpage**:
  - Create an `index.html` file in your repository.
  - The webpage should include:
    - Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) to structure the content.
    - Paragraphs (`<p>`) explaining the purpose of ARIA and web accessibility.
    - ARIA tags such as `role`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-label`, and `aria-labelledby`.
    - A navigation section (`<nav>`) with the `role` attribute.
    - An input field with an `aria-label`.
    - Comments in the code explaining the purpose of each ARIA tag used.

### Part 2: Testing and Validation

- **Test for Accessibility**:
  - Use browser tools or online services to test the accessibility of your webpage.
  - Make adjustments as necessary based on the feedback from these tools.

### Part 3: Deployment and Submission

- **Deploy Your Webpage Using GitHub Pages**:

  - In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the GitHub Pages section.
  - Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main`).
  - Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site.
  - Once deployed, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is live.

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.
